# Snoozer iOS App
Welcome to Snoozer! Please read through this README.md file before interacting with our app.

Snoozer is an innovative alarm system designed to redefine your morning routine. Unlike traditional alarms, Snoozer isn't just a wake-up call; it's a catalyst for an engaging morning routine. It encourages us to answer a trivia question before the alarm stops ringing. Additionally, by incorporating a social feature, users can interact with friends in the morning, fostering a sense of community and accountability â€“ by texting your friends to wake up or hold you accountable for snoozing.

To open Snoozer, open the project on Xcode and connect your phone. To navigate Snoozer, please submit your name and phone number in MainView if it's your first time logging in. Then, you'll be brought to an alarm view. Here, you can press the plus button to add alarms and edit the times of alarms you've already added. When the active alarm's time approaches, it will go off. Here, you can stop the alarm, going to the trivia page, or snooze, losing your streak, which will appear on the leaderboard in the profile tab. In the profile tab, you can see your friends' streaks as well as your name and phone number. In the chat tab, you can chat with your friends. You can add a chat with the compose button on the top right and open a chat with a friend.
